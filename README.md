### Portfolio Project: Retail Mall Customer Segmentation

#### Overview
This project analyzes customer data from a retail mall to identify distinct customer segments using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering techniques. The focus is on understanding customer behavior and demographics to inform targeted marketing strategies.

#### Case Study
A fictional retail mall chain seeks to optimize its marketing efforts and improve customer retention. By segmenting customers based on demographic, economic, and behavioral attributes, the chain aims to tailor promotions, enhance loyalty programs, and allocate resources efficiently across its branches.

#### Project Objectives
- Perform EDA to uncover key patterns in customer demographics, spending habits, and visit frequency.
- Segment customers into meaningful clusters using K-means clustering for actionable insights.
- Provide recommendations for personalized marketing and operational improvements based on segment characteristics.

#### Dataset
The dataset is **synthetic**, generated to simulate real-world retail mall customer data.

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **CustomerID**:  A unique identifier for each customer in the dataset.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
- **Age**: The customer's age in years.
- **Annual Income (₦)**: The customer's yearly income in Nigerian Naira (₦).
- **Spending Score (1–100)**: A score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior, ranging from 1 (low spender) to 100 (high spender).
- **Marital Status**: The marital status of the customer (e.g., Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed).
- **Profession**: The customer's profession or occupation (e.g., Engineer, Teacher, Entrepreneur).
- **Membership Duration (Years)**: The number of years the customer has held membership with the mall or service.
- **Mall Branch**: The branch of the mall frequented by the customer (e.g., Branch A, Branch B).
- **City Type**: The type of city the customer resides in (e.g., Metropolitan, Suburban, Rural).
- **Frequency of Visits/Month**: The average number of visits the customer makes to the mall or service per month.
- **Average Transaction Value (₦)**: The average amount spent by the customer per transaction, in Nigerian Naira (₦).
- **Loyalty Card Holder (Yes/No)**: Indicates whether the customer possesses a loyalty card (Yes or No).
- **Preferred Payment Method**: The customer's most commonly used payment method (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Mobile Payment).

#### Task
- Conduct EDA to extract insights on customer demographics, income-spending relationships, and behavioral trends.
- Apply K-means clustering to segment customers based on key features (e.g., Age, Income, Spending Score, Visit Frequency, Transaction Value).
- Interpret clusters to recommend strategies for customer engagement and retention.
